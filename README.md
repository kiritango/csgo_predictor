# csgo_predictor
A data science project on predicting professional CS:GO matches.
# Intro
Since I'm a big fan of professional CS:GO and recently started to learn data science, I've decided to combine these 2 interests into a project. The resut of the project should be a model based on data about teams, maps and tournaments. Doing this project, I don't expect great accuracy of my model because there are much more different factors reflecting on teams' performance than just statistics. The main goal of the project is to experience all stages of work with raw data.  
# Data collection
All data in this project has been extracted from an Internet resource HLTV.org, specializing in collecting various statistics of professional esports matches. For scraping the data I've used my module [hltv_scraper](https://github.com/kiritango/hltv_scraper).
